He's a cool ass dude. 👏 Alright, so my advice, and take it for what it's worth (I currently have a rap sheet of 24k in the hole) is to wait till end of week, Thurs or Fri, because I think AAL deeps a little mo'", "They have a current ratio of 0.37, a few more quarters and AAL is gonna go bust. I don't see the government being in any rush to bail AAL out.   \nJetBlue on the other hand, VERY GOOD investment as they expand their regional networks after partnering with AAL with a ratio of 0.61. Still not good but if someone is going to survive it's JBLU especially in the rona world where international air travel will take years to recover meanwhile regional travel will come back much faster."]

['Guys I’m fucked. I just got a text from my wife’s boyfriend saying my mom is going to stop sending me my monthly allowance because she saw a screenshot I posted on the internet (very unknown, underground expertise stock trading board, I don’t even know how a citizen like her found it) of my portfolio down 532% after I did a AZN 7/21 $60c as well as invested 73% of my portfolio into airline stocks two months ago (I thought it was a smart play because while the “experts” were saying to not buy, I could clearly see planes flying overhead so I knew something big was coming). Also I may have put my inheritance on TSLA puts. What’s the play that will get me back in the green so I can buy more tickets on this rocket ship. I keep trying to tell my mom the stock market is volatile (I don’t expect a wagecuck like her to know that tho) and that it’s important to continue to buy at the dips. But she said I’ve bought at the dip sixteen times now and is cutting off the debit card she gave me. I’m thinking about selling off my AEO holds and just taking the loss and putting that money in NAK and HTBX. \n\n🚀🚀🚀see you guys there']

The Regulated Transmission segment transmits electricity through transmission facilities owned and operated by FirstEnergy's utilities and the regulatory assets.

Both saw their stock prices drop by at least 17% Tuesday.\n\nFirstEnergy, which received subpoenas Tuesday in the ongoing federal investigation, is never named in the affidavit because neither the company nor any of its employees have yet been charged, the U.S. attorney handling the cases said Tuesday. In a brief statement late Tuesday, FirstEnergy said it was “reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate.”\n\nBut the company is clearly identified in the details throughout the affidavit, including the dates of its bankruptcy, words spoken by its CEO Charles Jones and its unique ownership of two nuclear power plants in Ohio.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dave DeVillers acknowledged Tuesday during a press conference that everyone knows the name of the unidentified company mentioned throughout the affidavit.\n\nFirstEnergy, which is among the 10 largest employers in Akron, began forecasting its own dire financial outlook in 2016. Of particular concern, company officials said, were two nuclear power plants operated by the company’s power generation arm, FirstEnergy Solutions.\n\nJones told investors in late 2017 that the company was considering various options, including a legislative bailout, selling off assets, filing bankruptcy or a combination of all three.\n\nThe timing coincided with Householder, who escaped an FBI investigation without facing charges more than a decade earlier, returning to state politics.\n\nSomehow — and it’s not yet clear how — a plan soon emerged that solved any of FirstEnergy’s money worries and also provided Householder the money and political power he wanted, the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit says Householder received a ride on a private jet FirstEnergy owned in January 2017. The Columbus Dispatch reported at the time that Householder and his son used the FirstEnergy jet to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSome time after that trip, money began to flow from FirstEnergy into a bank account belonging to a dark money group called Generation Now, which was controlled by Householder, the affidavit said.\n\nGroups like Generation Now can hide the names of donors per federal law. Generation Now was a prolific spender in the effort to pass a legislative bailout of FirstEnergy’s two failing nuclear power plants. Critics suspected that the dark money group was bankrolled by FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries, but the group’s campaign spokesman never revealed its donors.\n\nIn regular deposits of $250,000, investigators say Householder and his accomplices received a campaign war chest of $2.9 million to be used for their “personal benefit” and to help Householder win his speakership, according to the federal investigation.\n\nMillions more were spent in the spring and fall of 2018, during the state’s primary and general elections, to put candidates in office based on Householder’s and his accomplices’ beliefs that they would elect him speaker and support a legislative bailout worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy, according to the affidavit.\n\n...', "I know we haven't even made it past Microsoft and Tesla yet, but here me out.

['TLDR- APHA 5.50C 07/31 Aphria is going to beat earnings on July 29, resulting in tendies.\n\nMy positions:\n\nOptions- 5.50C 07/31\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/3d5uuiycicc51.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=831a64d45a25bf0f47c92369b01ab96beaceab02)\n\nShares-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares on TSX and in CAD](https://preview.redd.it/md74faqficc51.jpg?width=1158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0656b4d612a3ee5495d4a2edb4b857b7f6f436ca)\n\nI’ve been invested in this company for quite sometime and have been highly anticipating these earnings. I posted here last Q explaining why they would beat earnings, but it got deleted by the gay mods. Here is proof of my trade last earnings, they beat as I expected and I made 10k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options from Q3 bet](https://preview.redd.it/3m2ol2giicc51.jpg?width=883&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f38a03fd49bde388be66c3771eb8585a3b63d9)\n\n**Revenues**\n\nAphria is a Canadian LP and has 2 main revenue streams, cannabis sales & distribution revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Revenue Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/dz9ejr5licc51.jpg?width=785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f83911117265fc65e9362131e98fe1e2372e77cd)\n\nAphria is a hidden gem this quarter, as both of their revenue streams were positively affected by COVID-19- a big reason why they will beat this Q.\n\n**Distribution Revs**\n\nDistribution revenue comes from CC Pharma- a chain of 13,000 pharmacies throughout Europe but primarily located in Germany. CC Pharma was considered an essential service by the German Government and remained open throughout the pandemic and as a result saw a 15% increase in sales in March due to pantry loading; as indicated in their latest MD&A. While I don’t have access to sales for April or May, I expect April was similar to March while May returned to their usual sales. As you could see these revenues make up over 60% of their current revenues, while sales from CC are usually flat, a 5-10% increase over the quarter would set them on their way to beating earnings.\n\n**Cannabis Revs**\n\nThis is where most of the growth will come these earnings, as you can see in the picture above cannabis revenue increased by 22M, a 66% increase from the prior Q. Almost all of Aphria’s cannabis revenue comes from recreational sales, which will be the focus of this section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cannabis Rev Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/pre31mznicc51.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff64a572277a0f6ef8a56bb85ea381d00f1ebd0c)\n\nCOVID had a positive impact on Cannabis sales in Canada, dispensaries were considered essential services in most provinces during the lockdowns. Thankfully Health Canada shares the sales data so you don’t have to take my word for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canadian Rec Sales](https://preview.redd.it/0xid3ouqicc51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=504e9a884b5d1cbfaa9499a94d9d20c65cb720dc)\n\nSales grew to a record high in March, increasing 19% from the previous month. Not to be outdone, April had an even better month (6M/day vs 5.8M/day in March)- which is impressive because Ontario declared dispensaries non-essential for about a week before changing that decision and allowing delivery and curbside pickup. May continued to follow the trend and set another new high of 185M, totalling 547M for the quarter- a 20% increase from the past quarter.\n\nThe past 2 quarters have seen massive growth in rec sales for Aphria, in Q3 sales grew 54% while the market grew 17%, in Q2 sales grew 45% while the market grew 18%. They have continually increased their market share over the last few quarters, seeing an increase to 7.5% in Q2 and 9.5% in Q3. This is a trend we will likely see continue this quarter.\n\n***How will Aphria continue to increase sales?*** – What a great question, surprising coming from a group of autists like yourselves. In March 2019 Aphria received their license for part 4&5 of their Aphria One greenhouse. This added 800,000 square feet of additional growing space, bringing their growing capacity from 30,000kgs to 110,000kgs annually. In November Aphria added an additional 140,000kg of annualized cannabis production when their Aphria Diamond facility received it’s license, bringing its total annualized capacity to 225,000kgs. For those that aren’t familiar with the process, the grow cycle for cannabis is quite long, so the additional capacity has slowly increased every month, a big reason why they have been able to continually increase sales. The increased production capacity has also aligned perfectly with an increase in storefronts throughout Canada, last quarter saw an additional 184 stores open, a 30% increase from the end of November. This quarter has seen 130 stores open, a 16% increase from the end of February. Aphria will produce the most cannabis in company history this quarter, at the same time Canadians have access to more stores than ever before and it is clear that they are taking advantage as recreational sales in Canada are at an all time high.\n\nEverything is pointing towards a massive earnings beat for Aphria, which has historically resulted in a large increase in share price prior too earnings and on the day of earnings. Goodluck to everyone that chooses to buy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone interested in the sheer scale of a 800,00sqft greenhouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg)', "Been bullish on $APHA for a while. Them and $TRUL are, in my opinion, the industry's best picks. The Canadian roll out of legal weed was so royally fucked up by the government, that in turn ended up fucking a lot of companies. Mind you, a lot of them were also run into the ground themselves, but the government also lost out on millions of potential revenue. There were talks of an APHA and ACB merger, but I had heard that those talks have stopped recently. Either way, I'm in.", "APHA always beats earnings, but the gains never stay. Was trending down for a long time even before the coronavirus thing. Edit: not that coronavirus is a bad thing for weed - in fact it's relatively good for sales, but just to give some context that the market gyration wasn't the only reason why it's at where it is today.\n\nI think for anyone new to this stock, it’s probably a good idea to take some profit after earnings if the stock price goes up. \n\nLEAPs are also relatively cheap. I’m holding 1000 shares of APHA at $4.34 average.", "APHA always beats earnings, but the gains never stay. Was trending down for a long time even before the coronavirus thing.

Here's how it went:\n\nI added $1000 of my own to RH when people were talking about contango and the like. Made $500 on NAT (was an idiot and didn't sell when I was up $3500, but shit I made 50 percent gains on an insane meme stock so w/e) and pulled the initial investment, making this a profit account. Play money! From an anxiety/mental health perspective doing this was key. \n\nThen I took the $500 profit a few weeks back and guessed right on SPY calls, turned my $500 into $1500. \n\nThen last Thursday I YOLO'd said $1500 into AZN calls (58.50c, 60c, and further out 70c) sold Monday morning around 9 when they started tumbling, made $3k on those calls. \n\nI originally did this account with the sole purpose of getting enough cash to regularly buy weed with, so basically was looking to get $300 (cost of oz where I live) every other month or so. Green to green so to speak. But at this point I am likely to use the cash as part of a house down payment I'm looking to make soon. It's been a good ride and $4.5k isn't a ton of money, but I don't think I wanna blow up the account this year. Maybe next year!", "I mean I had strategy for all of it but I'm not going to pretend I am an expert or even particularly good at this -- NAT profits were based on the speculative market, I got out before the ball dropped.

That one was fun, was playing The Last of Us part 2 and had to take a breather, figured fuck it, and it worked out very well. \n\nAfter gaining that I almost withdrew the $1500 to buy a new beefy monitor but then some fellow autist on here mentioned AZN (this was before WSB went AZN crazy last week). I knew then that AZN would pop and drop on Monday morning due to covid vaccine (I thought it would get to 63 at max, I was mostly right on that) because AZN is different as a stock, but I got in so early (when AZN was 56.25 or something like that on Wednesday or Thursday before) that I still made bank.

['CYBR:  CyberArk for those who don’t know is a cyber security software company.  A lot of cyber security has been pumped up lately because everyone thinks more work from home means the need for more cloud based cyber security.  Back in May CYBR bought a cloud security company so everyone is taking the bait that they are suddenly going to be super cloud focused.  Problem for them is they have historically struggled to build their cloud business.  Even if they do sell more cloud it doesn’t necessarily help them because the services fortheir on prem product delivers about 30% of their revenues.  So more cloud sales will not be a like for like revenue replacement.\n\nWe’re around the 3 month highs today, and I think this thing will sink like a rock heading into earnings.\n\nWhy will this go down? They keep missing the mark.  They lowered guidance on their last call from COVID concerns, and nothing in the sales trends I see at my job (competitor) indicate things are going well for them.  They haven’t made it far in any competitive bids I’ve been involved in. There’s just no momentum for them in the market.  With budgets tighter all around companies are looking for cheap solutions, and they are by far the most expensive in the PAM space in so many ways.\n\nPrice action: They tested the 120 mark and bounced, I don’t see a breakout happening.  Earnings are coming 8/4 and I expect a dive leading in.\n\n\nPossible reason to continue this upward trend: New Gartner Magic quadrant was supposed to come out already, and they’ll probably continue to be named the leader.

Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.\n\n**1) Square, Inc $SQ \\[Information Technology Services\\] - BULLISH**\n\nSquare, Inc. engages in the provision of credit card payment processing solutions. It is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. The firms sellers downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile app, they can quickly and easily take their first payment, typically within minutes.\n\nBullish Square Case:\n\nThe ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for acquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other.\n\nAncillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its merchant client base and improve margins.\n\nElectronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square’s business model looks portable into international markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.\n\n[$SQ profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/nysoekpylac51.png?width=3260&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bc3045d8991e8db4aef7eb333ce9cb5092eb5f)\n\nIn both previous research posts, I discussed the bullish case of Twitter hinging on a successful subscription platform.\n\nSource: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nSubscription platforms require a reliable payment processor.

Coincidentally, that is the timeframe I pegged for $TWTR $40 Calls, and for the Subscription platform to be announced.\n\nPersonal Experience: I set up a Shopify site for a girl I know who started a brick-and-mortar clothing store. She is... technologically challenged, to say the least. Guess what she used for payments in retail? Square.

Both saw their stock prices drop by at least 17% Tuesday.\n\nFirstEnergy, which received subpoenas Tuesday in the ongoing federal investigation, is never named in the affidavit because neither the company nor any of its employees have yet been charged, the U.S. attorney handling the cases said Tuesday. In a brief statement late Tuesday, FirstEnergy said it was “reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate.”\n\nBut the company is clearly identified in the details throughout the affidavit, including the dates of its bankruptcy, words spoken by its CEO Charles Jones and its unique ownership of two nuclear power plants in Ohio.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dave DeVillers acknowledged Tuesday during a press conference that everyone knows the name of the unidentified company mentioned throughout the affidavit.\n\nFirstEnergy, which is among the 10 largest employers in Akron, began forecasting its own dire financial outlook in 2016. Of particular concern, company officials said, were two nuclear power plants operated by the company’s power generation arm, FirstEnergy Solutions.\n\nJones told investors in late 2017 that the company was considering various options, including a legislative bailout, selling off assets, filing bankruptcy or a combination of all three.\n\nThe timing coincided with Householder, who escaped an FBI investigation without facing charges more than a decade earlier, returning to state politics.\n\nSomehow — and it’s not yet clear how — a plan soon emerged that solved any of FirstEnergy’s money worries and also provided Householder the money and political power he wanted, the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit says Householder received a ride on a private jet FirstEnergy owned in January 2017. The Columbus Dispatch reported at the time that Householder and his son used the FirstEnergy jet to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSome time after that trip, money began to flow from FirstEnergy into a bank account belonging to a dark money group called Generation Now, which was controlled by Householder, the affidavit said.\n\nGroups like Generation Now can hide the names of donors per federal law. Generation Now was a prolific spender in the effort to pass a legislative bailout of FirstEnergy’s two failing nuclear power plants. Critics suspected that the dark money group was bankrolled by FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries, but the group’s campaign spokesman never revealed its donors.\n\nIn regular deposits of $250,000, investigators say Householder and his accomplices received a campaign war chest of $2.9 million to be used for their “personal benefit” and to help Householder win his speakership, according to the federal investigation.\n\nMillions more were spent in the spring and fall of 2018, during the state’s primary and general elections, to put candidates in office based on Householder’s and his accomplices’ beliefs that they would elect him speaker and support a legislative bailout worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy, according to the affidavit.\n\n...', 'Some of the richest and most powerful men in our world are still simps.

CVNA
['With advertisements making up significant parts of SMPs (Social Media Platforms\') revenues, yet becoming less and less effective - where do SMPs go from here? (The informal and lacking source for the advertisements being less effective is that like 1 in 3 instagram posts on your feed is an advertisement - and my entire friend group hadn\'t even realized how populated all the SMPs feeds have become until I pointed it out. And ECON 101 tells you when supply is up, demand usually falls). The only notable advertisement that I\'ve been able to formally recognize as coming from instagram was an Allbird advertisement - which has populated every single one of my feeds since I sent the link to a friend.\n\nData collection is already huge (look into an example big data is already being implemented [here](https://orbitalinsight.com/blog/global-parallels-realty-retail)) but I think that data collection could face some regulatory roadblocks in the future - see the GDPR currently or more recently, the invalidation of "[...the European Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-statement-schrems-ii-ruling-and)". The most valuable asset that SMPs have captured is actually the consumer and their leisure time \\[there is a shit-ton of [math](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.8316&rep=rep1&type=pdf) behind this stuff too for those that understand mathematics - and you can also look up "value of leisure time pdf" for other studies\\]. I anticipate that SMPs are going to start to experience the effects of diminishing marginal returns in terms of the revenue derived from advertisements as ads continued to become more and more diluted on feeds. \n\nTWTR is just a place to express yourself, communicate, and enjoy catered content. Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \\[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency. \n\nTwitter\'s advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - (\'data licensing and other\' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers\' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).\n\nThe only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \\[10+ years down the line\\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for "premium" listings \\[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces. \n\nWhy TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.\n\n**tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \\[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation. \n\n**tl;dr** *see below position*\n\nTWTR $65c 01/21/2022 & long on the underlying', "There's a lot of people that think this company will never actually make any money.\n\nMyself included.

Their expected revenue for this quarter is $361,082!! That’s freakin wild. They are bringing in 3x the amount this quarter than what they brought last quarter. They beat there ridiculously high EPS by $.02 last quarter and for this quarter it’s even higher. It is expected to beat it as well according to the CEO, because they are “swimming in money”. The current market cap is listed as 600 million dollars. That is a huge EPS growth as well as a crazy high market cap. Their net income has been growing every quarter. On 09/30/19 their net income was -$13,740, on 12/31/19 it turned profitable to $12,740, last quarter on 03/31/20 it was a whopping $39,549. I can’t even imagine the net income for this upcoming quarter will be. Last quarter on 03/31/20 they reported a cash flow of $35,201, this upcoming quarter it is expected to be $67,729. Almost double the cash flow!  Average trading volume is around 12 million. They pay an annual dividend at ¢.56 per share. \n\nBasically, everything about this company is positive.

I realized, while hes fucking my wife, I’m hovering over my Robinhood app watching TSLA go up and down by 54 cents. Should I just close out my accounts, take my $204 profit in the past year and try to rebuild my relationship with my wife? Maybe I can even get Brad out of the house if I focus more on what’s important.\n\nAlso, I’ve probably spent roughly 8 hours a day researching, reading and investing in stocks. Let’s just take the last 3 months, everyday for 8 hours a day, with a net profit of $204. That’s roughly 1600 hours a month, or 5000 hours in the past three months for $204. That comes out to about 0.04 cents per hour. What color should I get my Lamborghini?', 'Your doing good bruh. You are still net positive for the year. God speed bruh.

That’s no more than 5.5% a year. Hardly an avalanche of selling. He still has at least a billion dollars of stock, probably more depending on ownership structures, so at least 80% of his net worth based on current holdings, past sales, and my guess as to what his wealth was when he started this job (8 figures, which is small compared to his equity in Moderna). \n\nThese numbers look even better when you include stuff that is indirectly his as 100% his instead of like 50%  - current form 4 shows control of around 24 million shares, which is about 2 billion dollars. \n\nThe chief medical officer always sells his full grants whenever they vest. He wasn’t rich before this job, I assume he’s locking in his wealth level.  It’s like telling your wife or husband you shouldn’t take a bunch off the table and fund kids college, buy the house you want, etc when you make $5mil YOLOing 100k on tesla calls. Good luck with that if they are aware. He still has several hundred thousand future shares to vest in the future so he’s synthetically long via those at around 3 or 4 million, which is still a quarter or a third or something of his wealth. \n\nThey’ve done this stock up, stock down, stock sideways.

I'm not sticking around to find out, good luck to the call buyers that are still holding. I bought 400 shares in 50-100 share increments the second half of 2018, cost average was around $335. I started selling in increments last week, cost average around $1,550.\n\nI think I'm getting out at the best possible time, the company is valued at $100 billion more than Toyota. And it's valued more than every other major carmaker put together. I think the stock at $1,000 is priced for perfection, $1,500+ is just nuts considering the macroeconomic backdrop. Nonetheless, I like the company and hope it takes over the world. I'd like to buy a Model Y whenever my Camry kicks the bucket, maybe it will have the zero-cobalt million-mile battery in it by then. Maybe Elon will get the body paint and paneling issues worked out by then, both of my buddies who bought Model 3s the past two years have had issues with the paint, interiors and body paneling that's required warranty repairs by Tesla. I've ridden in a Model Y and the only thing I dislike is the crossbar in the back window that makes getting a clear look out of your rearview difficult.\n\nThe $480,000ish profit was all in taxable accounts unfortunately. So 20 percent long term capital gains tax, minus another 3.8 percent in net investment income tax. So $365,000 left over. No state income tax. Will probably spend it on more Goldman Sachs shares on the next pullback. I'll send a check to the IRS for the $115,000 next week when the last of my sales clear. No sense putting it in a HYSA until next year, out of sight and out of mind.", 'TIL about net investment income tax. Wtf man why they gotta take everything', 'Well, everyone was declaring Tesla is going to go bankrupt in a year. I was in the red for 3+ months with all my net worth on Tesla. I was happy to come out of that rollercoaster positive. If I had foresight to hold for few more months, I would have come out much richer.', "Originally I was thinking I could at least sell the contracts once the price ran up a bit, so I wasn't concerned. I never imagined the stock would stay the same or even go down. I'm considering just selling and cutting my massive and basically unrecoverable losses, but I wanna wait for a week maybe and see if there's an up day to get the max I can. Maybe holding these worthless calls is stupid, but I'm holding them out of the desperate hope that the stock rises with even more positive news etc. You're probably right that I should just sell and net my 3k."]

The beauty of long plays is that the stock only needs to move a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.\n\n**1) Square, Inc $SQ \\[Information Technology Services\\] - BULLISH**\n\nSquare, Inc. engages in the provision of credit card payment processing solutions. It is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. The firms sellers downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile app, they can quickly and easily take their first payment, typically within minutes.\n\nBullish Square Case:\n\nThe ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for acquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other.\n\nAncillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its merchant client base and improve margins.\n\nElectronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square’s business model looks portable into international markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.\n\n[$SQ profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/nysoekpylac51.png?width=3260&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bc3045d8991e8db4aef7eb333ce9cb5092eb5f)\n\nIn both previous research posts, I discussed the bullish case of Twitter hinging on a successful subscription platform.\n\nSource: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nSubscription platforms require a reliable payment processor. Guess who Dorsey is going to choose to process payments for Twitter's subscription platform?\n\n[$SQ overlaid with $SHOP, following the same trajectory](https://preview.redd.it/f39wy6xzlac51.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=78446946aeae07ccec3e4c5d913526b14778d88a)\n\n$SHOP is trading at a 69x Price to Revenue multiple, with -$1.16 EPS. $SQ is trading at a 11x Price to Revenue multiple, with $0.72 EPS. Not only is $SQ profitable, it is in a similar niche to $SHOP and has a huge growth opportunity with Twitter's subscription platform.\n\nLet's take a look at the unusual options activity scanner:\n\n[$2 Million in $97.5 calls, expiring Aug 21. Earnings Aug 5](https://preview.redd.it/uds5nz41mac51.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=7015df30ea422ebb735876b1998710f76433181c)\n\n[$190 Jan 15 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/ip2cgk33mac51.png?width=2152&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf1811b2b345cef4a85fa7a26ad2028613ce3d90)\n\n[$100 Jan 15 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/9flfena4mac51.png?width=2190&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e2e4415356487cf59ddcc32995a0b5c9a2b80cc)\n\nBig bullish bets on $SQ, notably dated around Jan 15. Coincidentally, that is the timeframe I pegged for $TWTR $40 Calls, and for the Subscription platform to be announced.\n\nPersonal Experience: I set up a Shopify site for a girl I know who started a brick-and-mortar clothing store. She is... technologically challenged, to say the least. Guess what she used for payments in retail? Square. Even with Shopify's poor integration with Square, she stuck with it (Against my advice for inventory & tracking purposes). As states reopen, and smaller brick and mortars are back, farmers markets, carnivals, etc, expect growth from $SQ.\n\nI am eyeing a $118-$122 entry to incorporate the stock into my portfolio, and purchase options.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*SQ $130c Aug 7 2020, trading at $6.57 at time of writing. 41% Probability ITM.

It provides online and retail sports wagering offerings, online daily fantasy contests and online casino games.\n\n[$DKNG profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/sr8b1nm5mac51.png?width=3242&format=png&auto=webp&s=0770696e41a276f032d270cf9d6d98bcd30d60d5)\n\nCurrently, only 5 states have legal online gambling \\[Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia\\]. 23 states have Sports Betting legal and or in legislation.\n\n[From https:\\/\\/investmentu.com\\/sports-betting-stocks\\/](https://preview.redd.it/bz3y3er6mac51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a19bc4766facbf1a9b18d2a1375c6cf367676539)\n\n**Focus on casino gambling!**\n\nYou can gamble at a casino whether there are sports on or not, and the following states are most likely to legalize online casino gambling in the next 12 months \\[based on legislation\\]:\n\n* California \\[40 Million Population\\]\n* Connecticut \\[3.6 Million Population\\]\n* Illinois \\[13 Million Population\\]\n* Indiana \\[6.6 Million Population\\]\n* Massachusetts \\[6.8 Million Population\\]\n* Nevada \\[2.8 Million Population\\]\n* New York \\[20 Million Population\\]\n\nThese states represent 92.8 Million people, or 30% of the US population.\n\nSource: [https://www.bettingusa.com/states/](https://www.bettingusa.com/states/)\n\n[$DKNG overlaid with $PENN, following the same trajectory](https://preview.redd.it/8o8gm768mac51.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e6f1b01a9b8349b260b3a676d81752f41444c34)\n\n52 Week high for $DKNG is $44. With Americans sitting at home, legalizing online gambling makes sense financially for governments and to satiate the appetite of the restless, short-attention span population.\n\nLet's take a look at the unusual options activity scanner:\n\n[A stream of bullish plays, ranging from $30 to $40, expiring July 24 and Aug 21.](https://preview.redd.it/ohi3hnodmac51.png?width=2190&format=png&auto=webp&s=821768f29396516fe2fcf679dea556e932307c45)\n\n$DKNG is both a stock and option play. I am eyeing a $28-$30 entry to incorporate the stock into my portfolio, and purchase options.\n\nPersonal Experience: A buddy of mine ran an (illegal) sports book in college, and netted 6 figures over the course of four years. Tons of potential tax dollars on the line.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*DKNG $40 Aug 21 2020, trading at $3.50 at time of writing. 36.5% Probability ITM.

I remember hawking the stock price while on vacation in Paris, when the plane crashed in March '19. My ex was pissed. I was more pissed for not picking up some stock and options when it bottomed around $100 a few months ago.\n\nBullish Boeing case:\n\nBoeing has a large backlog that covers several years of production for the most popular aircraft, which gives us confidence in aggregate demand for aerospace products.\n\nBoeing is well-positioned to benefit from emerging market growth in revenue passenger kilometers and a robust developed market replacement cycle over the next two decades.\n\nWe expect that commercial airframe manufacturing will remain a duopoly over the foreseeable future. We think customers will not have many options other than continuing to rely on incumbent aircraft suppliers.\n\n[$BA profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/3882c94fmac51.png?width=3258&format=png&auto=webp&s=4039958fa26f8fd1e658faad619db137a6bb8151)\n\nCOVID-19 has been a blessing in disguise for $BA. COVID-19 gifted $BA time, the most important thing they needed to fix their issues. Airlines are not flying, so it is excusable for $BA to have cancelled orders. Finally, as long as the oil-based dollar is the global currency, $BA will be in business selling weapons.\n\n[$BA overlaid with $RTX, another major defense contractor.](https://preview.redd.it/43dez8egmac51.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=545bea011a37291079d6e6469e3e4e94c073b67d)\n\nDespite the airline issues, $BA is tracking $RTX, because defense is where the big money is.\n\nLet's take a look at the unusual options activity scanner:\n\n[$1.3 Million in $195 Sept 18 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/c5ecerphmac51.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=41573918e442ff62aa5e1cb67782fe2cda549019)\n\n[$800K in $180 Aug 21 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/qvuwv6nimac51.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=109379e421b4f970e46ae42a093ee6104f208a82)\n\nEarnings is July 29th, but this is not an earnings play. The stock is consolidating in the $170-$180 range, a huge support and resistance in 2020. I am eyeing a $165-$170 entry to incorporate the stock into my portfolio, and purchase options.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*BA $200c Oct 16 2020, trading at $14.01 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*\n\n**Long Term Play:**\n\n*BA $240c Jun 18 2021, trading $18.75 at time of writing. 20% Probability ITM*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on my research, $SQ stands to gain from $TWTR news, $DKNG is poised to dominate online gambling, $BA is slowly recovering, and will not fail.\n\n**TL,DR:**\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*SQ $130c Aug 7 2020, trading at $6.57 at time of writing. 41% Probability ITM.

If you are green today--which I highly doubt--cash out your gains and/or sell some weekly calls. If you dont know what this means, then this post is definitely for you.', "Okay so this post is not for any quick moves.. this is advice for 6 months to a year. AMD is having success on both it's major fronts. It's CPU wins should be well known and are the reason it has good cash flow: \n\n* Today it just announced two new OEM partnerships with laptop makers. \n* They are dominating Intel currently in the custom market\n* They are at least competitive in the mobile market somewhere Intel is not yet. \n* They are progressively chipping away at the server market share from Intel with cheaper hardware that outperforms much more expensive Intel hardware. \n* The Intel product line has repeatedly gotten criticism for being stale, unexciting and expensive and that was before their star engineer quit months ago\n* CPU partnerships lead to GPU partnerships\n* The fact that they are fabless means they have really good relationships with semiconductor makers. They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket. AMD has their CPU game on lock and their R&D is finally funding their GPU.

I'm not sticking around to find out, good luck to the call buyers that are still holding. I bought 400 shares in 50-100 share increments the second half of 2018, cost average was around $335. I started selling in increments last week, cost average around $1,550.\n\nI think I'm getting out at the best possible time, the company is valued at $100 billion more than Toyota. And it's valued more than every other major carmaker put together. I think the stock at $1,000 is priced for perfection, $1,500+ is just nuts considering the macroeconomic backdrop. Nonetheless, I like the company and hope it takes over the world. I'd like to buy a Model Y whenever my Camry kicks the bucket, maybe it will have the zero-cobalt million-mile battery in it by then. Maybe Elon will get the body paint and paneling issues worked out by then, both of my buddies who bought Model 3s the past two years have had issues with the paint, interiors and body paneling that's required warranty repairs by Tesla. I've ridden in a Model Y and the only thing I dislike is the crossbar in the back window that makes getting a clear look out of your rearview difficult.\n\nThe $480,000ish profit was all in taxable accounts unfortunately. So 20 percent long term capital gains tax, minus another 3.8 percent in net investment income tax. So $365,000 left over. No state income tax. Will probably spend it on more Goldman Sachs shares on the next pullback. I'll send a check to the IRS for the $115,000 next week when the last of my sales clear.

So the selling pressure is of at that certain point.\n- there could be a run-up since Q2 is next Wednesday. So holding for at least a few days is viable.\n- AMD has been trading 50-58 for weeks, while Nasdaq only went up due to world wide stimulus (stimuli?).

For the past 12 years, $CROX has maintained a constant revenue of over 1.2 BILLION by adapting viciously to modern sales channels and refusing to lay dormant with its vertically scaling exclusive counterparts.

CC Pharma was considered an essential service by the German Government and remained open throughout the pandemic and as a result saw a 15% increase in sales in March due to pantry loading; as indicated in their latest MD&A. While I don’t have access to sales for April or May, I expect April was similar to March while May returned to their usual sales. As you could see these revenues make up over 60% of their current revenues, while sales from CC are usually flat, a 5-10% increase over the quarter would set them on their way to beating earnings.\n\n**Cannabis Revs**\n\nThis is where most of the growth will come these earnings, as you can see in the picture above cannabis revenue increased by 22M, a 66% increase from the prior Q. Almost all of Aphria’s cannabis revenue comes from recreational sales, which will be the focus of this section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cannabis Rev Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/pre31mznicc51.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff64a572277a0f6ef8a56bb85ea381d00f1ebd0c)\n\nCOVID had a positive impact on Cannabis sales in Canada, dispensaries were considered essential services in most provinces during the lockdowns. Thankfully Health Canada shares the sales data so you don’t have to take my word for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canadian Rec Sales](https://preview.redd.it/0xid3ouqicc51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=504e9a884b5d1cbfaa9499a94d9d20c65cb720dc)\n\nSales grew to a record high in March, increasing 19% from the previous month. Not to be outdone, April had an even better month (6M/day vs 5.8M/day in March)- which is impressive because Ontario declared dispensaries non-essential for about a week before changing that decision and allowing delivery and curbside pickup. May continued to follow the trend and set another new high of 185M, totalling 547M for the quarter- a 20% increase from the past quarter.\n\nThe past 2 quarters have seen massive growth in rec sales for Aphria, in Q3 sales grew 54% while the market grew 17%, in Q2 sales grew 45% while the market grew 18%. They have continually increased their market share over the last few quarters, seeing an increase to 7.5% in Q2 and 9.5% in Q3. This is a trend we will likely see continue this quarter.\n\n***How will Aphria continue to increase sales?*** – What a great question, surprising coming from a group of autists like yourselves. In March 2019 Aphria received their license for part 4&5 of their Aphria One greenhouse. This added 800,000 square feet of additional growing space, bringing their growing capacity from 30,000kgs to 110,000kgs annually. In November Aphria added an additional 140,000kg of annualized cannabis production when their Aphria Diamond facility received it’s license, bringing its total annualized capacity to 225,000kgs. For those that aren’t familiar with the process, the grow cycle for cannabis is quite long, so the additional capacity has slowly increased every month, a big reason why they have been able to continually increase sales. The increased production capacity has also aligned perfectly with an increase in storefronts throughout Canada, last quarter saw an additional 184 stores open, a 30% increase from the end of November. This quarter has seen 130 stores open, a 16% increase from the end of February. Aphria will produce the most cannabis in company history this quarter, at the same time Canadians have access to more stores than ever before and it is clear that they are taking advantage as recreational sales in Canada are at an all time high.\n\nEverything is pointing towards a massive earnings beat for Aphria, which has historically resulted in a large increase in share price prior too earnings and on the day of earnings. Goodluck to everyone that chooses to buy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone interested in the sheer scale of a 800,00sqft greenhouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg)', "I sold 200 shares at 670 a couple of month ago with a 400%+ return.

NAT
["Yeah. Here's how it went:\n\nI added $1000 of my own to RH when people were talking about contango and the like. Made $500 on NAT (was an idiot and didn't sell when I was up $3500, but shit I made 50 percent gains on an insane meme stock so w/e) and pulled the initial investment, making this a profit account. Play money! From an anxiety/mental health perspective doing this was key. \n\nThen I took the $500 profit a few weeks back and guessed right on SPY calls, turned my $500 into $1500. \n\nThen last Thursday I YOLO'd said $1500 into AZN calls (58.50c, 60c, and further out 70c) sold Monday morning around 9 when they started tumbling, made $3k on those calls. \n\nI originally did this account with the sole purpose of getting enough cash to regularly buy weed with, so basically was looking to get $300 (cost of oz where I live) every other month or so. Green to green so to speak. But at this point I am likely to use the cash as part of a house down payment I'm looking to make soon. It's been a good ride and $4.5k isn't a ton of money, but I don't think I wanna blow up the account this year. Maybe next year!", "I mean I had strategy for all of it but I'm not going to pretend I am an expert or even particularly good at this -- NAT profits were based on the speculative market, I got out before the ball dropped. I bought SPY on Friday morning (July 10) when it was a bit down because it seemed undervalued. That one was fun, was playing The Last of Us part 2 and had to take a breather, figured fuck it, and it worked out very well. \n\nAfter gaining that I almost withdrew the $1500 to buy a new beefy monitor but then some fellow autist on here mentioned AZN (this was before WSB went AZN crazy last week). I knew then that AZN would pop and drop on Monday morning due to covid vaccine (I thought it would get to 63 at max, I was mostly right on that) because AZN is different as a stock, but I got in so early (when AZN was 56.25 or something like that on Wednesday or Thursday before) that I still made bank. With both NAT and AZN I basically just made money by getting in early and getting out in time.

Questions, comments, concerns would be appreciated.\n\nI’m holding onto 5 calls expiring this August!', 'For those living under a rock, SPAC’s, also known as blank check companies, are piles of cash dedicated to acquiring an interest in a private company, so they can take it public. Ackman has structured his as a tontine. This will encourage early investors to hold onto their shares, in favor of a greater percentage of the warrants. He also doubled the traditional $10 PIPE shares and $11.50 warrants to $20 per share and $23 warrants.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation on what Ackman will pick, and you can take your best guess, but he wants a minority stake in the neighborhood of 15-30%. The SPAC has 4B in it, and he’s pledged 1-3B of Pershing’s money toward the deal. So we’re looking for something with a price tag between 16.6B and 46.6B. My opinion is that anything that big he picks is going to be a rocket ship once it’s brought to market. \n\nPosition: 470 shares in PSTH.U (The SPAC) & 400 shares in PSHZF (Pershing Square)', "You people?\n\nDon't make me para-graph my testicles onto your forehead.", 'Holding onto 3x $11 8/4 calls so wish me luck!', "Loans and Business services - mostly the asset recovery and restructuring of business related expenses.

The company was a subsidiary and then broken off of FE for the purpose of holding onto the two Nuclear Power plants.  However the prosecutor's indictment is attacking this company separation as fictional.  FE is going to be dragged through this in a deep and punitive way.  Wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't also drag in the governor whose been pretty popular with Ohio as a whole, but who signed the controversial law (a bailout for the nuclear energy plants) as soon as it was available, and who was largely financially supported by FE in his election.", 'Considering it. I am thinking whether to purchase the spread back at a loss and roll, or to just hold onto my current positions and wait a bit longer. I have until 8/5 for earnings.

I still have time', "The Earnings call is @ 5pm eastern but the Report gets uploaded right when the market closes. The earnings call @ 5pm just goes onto clarify and mitigate anything in the report that immediately stands out.

PAM
['CYBR:  CyberArk for those who don’t know is a cyber security software company.  A lot of cyber security has been pumped up lately because everyone thinks more work from home means the need for more cloud based cyber security.  Back in May CYBR bought a cloud security company so everyone is taking the bait that they are suddenly going to be super cloud focused.  Problem for them is they have historically struggled to build their cloud business.  Even if they do sell more cloud it doesn’t necessarily help them because the services fortheir on prem product delivers about 30% of their revenues.  So more cloud sales will not be a like for like revenue replacement.\n\nWe’re around the 3 month highs today, and I think this thing will sink like a rock heading into earnings.\n\nWhy will this go down? They keep missing the mark.  They lowered guidance on their last call from COVID concerns, and nothing in the sales trends I see at my job (competitor) indicate things are going well for them.  They haven’t made it far in any competitive bids I’ve been involved in. There’s just no momentum for them in the market.  With budgets tighter all around companies are looking for cheap solutions, and they are by far the most expensive in the PAM space in so many ways.\n\nPrice action: They tested the 120 mark and bounced, I don’t see a breakout happening.  Earnings are coming 8/4 and I expect a dive leading in.\n\n\nPossible reason to continue this upward trend: New Gartner Magic quadrant was supposed to come out already, and they’ll probably continue to be named the leader.  So that news could happen any day.\n\nPosition: 8/21 100p\nNot much volume but I like it']

CC Pharma was considered an essential service by the German Government and remained open throughout the pandemic and as a result saw a 15% increase in sales in March due to pantry loading; as indicated in their latest MD&A. While I don’t have access to sales for April or May, I expect April was similar to March while May returned to their usual sales. As you could see these revenues make up over 60% of their current revenues, while sales from CC are usually flat, a 5-10% increase over the quarter would set them on their way to beating earnings.\n\n**Cannabis Revs**\n\nThis is where most of the growth will come these earnings, as you can see in the picture above cannabis revenue increased by 22M, a 66% increase from the prior Q. Almost all of Aphria’s cannabis revenue comes from recreational sales, which will be the focus of this section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cannabis Rev Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/pre31mznicc51.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff64a572277a0f6ef8a56bb85ea381d00f1ebd0c)\n\nCOVID had a positive impact on Cannabis sales in Canada, dispensaries were considered essential services in most provinces during the lockdowns. Thankfully Health Canada shares the sales data so you don’t have to take my word for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canadian Rec Sales](https://preview.redd.it/0xid3ouqicc51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=504e9a884b5d1cbfaa9499a94d9d20c65cb720dc)\n\nSales grew to a record high in March, increasing 19% from the previous month. Not to be outdone, April had an even better month (6M/day vs 5.8M/day in March)- which is impressive because Ontario declared dispensaries non-essential for about a week before changing that decision and allowing delivery and curbside pickup. May continued to follow the trend and set another new high of 185M, totalling 547M for the quarter- a 20% increase from the past quarter.\n\nThe past 2 quarters have seen massive growth in rec sales for Aphria, in Q3 sales grew 54% while the market grew 17%, in Q2 sales grew 45% while the market grew 18%. They have continually increased their market share over the last few quarters, seeing an increase to 7.5% in Q2 and 9.5% in Q3. This is a trend we will likely see continue this quarter.\n\n***How will Aphria continue to increase sales?*** – What a great question, surprising coming from a group of autists like yourselves. In March 2019 Aphria received their license for part 4&5 of their Aphria One greenhouse. This added 800,000 square feet of additional growing space, bringing their growing capacity from 30,000kgs to 110,000kgs annually. In November Aphria added an additional 140,000kg of annualized cannabis production when their Aphria Diamond facility received it’s license, bringing its total annualized capacity to 225,000kgs. For those that aren’t familiar with the process, the grow cycle for cannabis is quite long, so the additional capacity has slowly increased every month, a big reason why they have been able to continually increase sales. The increased production capacity has also aligned perfectly with an increase in storefronts throughout Canada, last quarter saw an additional 184 stores open, a 30% increase from the end of November. This quarter has seen 130 stores open, a 16% increase from the end of February. Aphria will produce the most cannabis in company history this quarter, at the same time Canadians have access to more stores than ever before and it is clear that they are taking advantage as recreational sales in Canada are at an all time high.\n\nEverything is pointing towards a massive earnings beat for Aphria, which has historically resulted in a large increase in share price prior too earnings and on the day of earnings. Goodluck to everyone that chooses to buy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone interested in the sheer scale of a 800,00sqft greenhouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg)']

["Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps", "Oh, you're right about that.  It'll be 80% lower in six months regardless.  They know that, that's why they're selling as much as possible now.\n\nThe company doesn't even have to be doomed.  It could be going swimmingly and it'll still be 80% lower."]

Both saw their stock prices drop by at least 17% Tuesday.\n\nFirstEnergy, which received subpoenas Tuesday in the ongoing federal investigation, is never named in the affidavit because neither the company nor any of its employees have yet been charged, the U.S. attorney handling the cases said Tuesday. In a brief statement late Tuesday, FirstEnergy said it was “reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate.”\n\nBut the company is clearly identified in the details throughout the affidavit, including the dates of its bankruptcy, words spoken by its CEO Charles Jones and its unique ownership of two nuclear power plants in Ohio.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dave DeVillers acknowledged Tuesday during a press conference that everyone knows the name of the unidentified company mentioned throughout the affidavit.\n\nFirstEnergy, which is among the 10 largest employers in Akron, began forecasting its own dire financial outlook in 2016. Of particular concern, company officials said, were two nuclear power plants operated by the company’s power generation arm, FirstEnergy Solutions.\n\nJones told investors in late 2017 that the company was considering various options, including a legislative bailout, selling off assets, filing bankruptcy or a combination of all three.\n\nThe timing coincided with Householder, who escaped an FBI investigation without facing charges more than a decade earlier, returning to state politics.\n\nSomehow — and it’s not yet clear how — a plan soon emerged that solved any of FirstEnergy’s money worries and also provided Householder the money and political power he wanted, the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit says Householder received a ride on a private jet FirstEnergy owned in January 2017. The Columbus Dispatch reported at the time that Householder and his son used the FirstEnergy jet to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSome time after that trip, money began to flow from FirstEnergy into a bank account belonging to a dark money group called Generation Now, which was controlled by Householder, the affidavit said.\n\nGroups like Generation Now can hide the names of donors per federal law. Generation Now was a prolific spender in the effort to pass a legislative bailout of FirstEnergy’s two failing nuclear power plants. Critics suspected that the dark money group was bankrolled by FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries, but the group’s campaign spokesman never revealed its donors.\n\nIn regular deposits of $250,000, investigators say Householder and his accomplices received a campaign war chest of $2.9 million to be used for their “personal benefit” and to help Householder win his speakership, according to the federal investigation.\n\nMillions more were spent in the spring and fall of 2018, during the state’s primary and general elections, to put candidates in office based on Householder’s and his accomplices’ beliefs that they would elect him speaker and support a legislative bailout worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy, according to the affidavit.\n\n...', "I know the hype about this stock was months ago when it was around $8 or $9, but their earnings are next month on 08/17 and the call prices right now are super cheap.

Their expected revenue for this quarter is $361,082!! That’s freakin wild. They are bringing in 3x the amount this quarter than what they brought last quarter. They beat there ridiculously high EPS by $.02 last quarter and for this quarter it’s even higher. It is expected to beat it as well according to the CEO, because they are “swimming in money”. The current market cap is listed as 600 million dollars. That is a huge EPS growth as well as a crazy high market cap. Their net income has been growing every quarter. On 09/30/19 their net income was -$13,740, on 12/31/19 it turned profitable to $12,740, last quarter on 03/31/20 it was a whopping $39,549. I can’t even imagine the net income for this upcoming quarter will be. Last quarter on 03/31/20 they reported a cash flow of $35,201, this upcoming quarter it is expected to be $67,729. Almost double the cash flow!  Average trading volume is around 12 million. They pay an annual dividend at ¢.56 per share. \n\nBasically, everything about this company is positive. They are profiting like crazy especially during this pandemic because of the over supply of oil and they are charging whatever amount they want for companies to store their oil on here. \n\n\n**Recent news:**\n\n-\tNordic American Tankers Chairman and CEO bought 50,000 shares of NAT on July 2nd\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-135541987.html)\n\n-\tNordic’s director, son of CEO, purchases 50,000 shares on June 24th \n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-140837346.html)\n\n-\tNAT CEO says oil glut is creating revenue.

They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket.

Both saw their stock prices drop by at least 17% Tuesday.\n\nFirstEnergy, which received subpoenas Tuesday in the ongoing federal investigation, is never named in the affidavit because neither the company nor any of its employees have yet been charged, the U.S. attorney handling the cases said Tuesday. In a brief statement late Tuesday, FirstEnergy said it was “reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate.”\n\nBut the company is clearly identified in the details throughout the affidavit, including the dates of its bankruptcy, words spoken by its CEO Charles Jones and its unique ownership of two nuclear power plants in Ohio.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dave DeVillers acknowledged Tuesday during a press conference that everyone knows the name of the unidentified company mentioned throughout the affidavit.\n\nFirstEnergy, which is among the 10 largest employers in Akron, began forecasting its own dire financial outlook in 2016. Of particular concern, company officials said, were two nuclear power plants operated by the company’s power generation arm, FirstEnergy Solutions.\n\nJones told investors in late 2017 that the company was considering various options, including a legislative bailout, selling off assets, filing bankruptcy or a combination of all three.\n\nThe timing coincided with Householder, who escaped an FBI investigation without facing charges more than a decade earlier, returning to state politics.\n\nSomehow — and it’s not yet clear how — a plan soon emerged that solved any of FirstEnergy’s money worries and also provided Householder the money and political power he wanted, the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit says Householder received a ride on a private jet FirstEnergy owned in January 2017. The Columbus Dispatch reported at the time that Householder and his son used the FirstEnergy jet to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSome time after that trip, money began to flow from FirstEnergy into a bank account belonging to a dark money group called Generation Now, which was controlled by Householder, the affidavit said.\n\nGroups like Generation Now can hide the names of donors per federal law. Generation Now was a prolific spender in the effort to pass a legislative bailout of FirstEnergy’s two failing nuclear power plants. Critics suspected that the dark money group was bankrolled by FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries, but the group’s campaign spokesman never revealed its donors.\n\nIn regular deposits of $250,000, investigators say Householder and his accomplices received a campaign war chest of $2.9 million to be used for their “personal benefit” and to help Householder win his speakership, according to the federal investigation.\n\nMillions more were spent in the spring and fall of 2018, during the state’s primary and general elections, to put candidates in office based on Householder’s and his accomplices’ beliefs that they would elect him speaker and support a legislative bailout worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy, according to the affidavit.\n\n...', 'This is not YOLO enough, but buy AGQ or AGQ calls sell when it reaches the price of a new car.

They don't give a fuck about their equity they don't need it atm, they are receiving enough money from the government and don't even have to worry about procuring tge monetary means for production, the money they would rake in overshadows any of the equity they might lose from sell offs and in the end they will always make back these losses on new big prs like when their phase 3 trial was announced....they just testified before congress yesterday showing  almost complete immune response and no safety concerns...again which us heavily based on the mrna model (hence their ticker) im sorry but you are basing this off nothing lmao\n\nOh yea and this https://investors.modernatx.com/node/9516/html"]

["No - you are only 1/4 correct. I had 4k in my account at the time, and saw that $SLV had a gap up 2 days ago. So yesterday I wagered 1k on $SLV calls expiring 7/24, given that there was a high chance it was going to continue to gap, due to the following reasons:\n\n- $SLV had been consolidating for a while and finally broke resistance\n- $SLV's previous gap up was followed by 3-4 days of gap ups\n- Metals and oil melt-up as a whole\n- Recent money flowing from tech to financials/energy\n- Worries of 2nd COVID wave \n- $SLV FOMO\n\nMy mistake was that I didn't scale out and just sell 1/4 of my position, and let the other 3/4 ride on the house. I would've made almost 10k, instead of 4k, if I had done this.\n\nRegardless, I've made another 1k wager this morning on $SLV, by rolling over into $22.50 Calls expiring 7/24. It's already up 1.3k. I predict that there'll be another gap up going into tomorrow, before this melt up ceases.

['With advertisements making up significant parts of SMPs (Social Media Platforms\') revenues, yet becoming less and less effective - where do SMPs go from here? (The informal and lacking source for the advertisements being less effective is that like 1 in 3 instagram posts on your feed is an advertisement - and my entire friend group hadn\'t even realized how populated all the SMPs feeds have become until I pointed it out. And ECON 101 tells you when supply is up, demand usually falls). The only notable advertisement that I\'ve been able to formally recognize as coming from instagram was an Allbird advertisement - which has populated every single one of my feeds since I sent the link to a friend.\n\nData collection is already huge (look into an example big data is already being implemented [here](https://orbitalinsight.com/blog/global-parallels-realty-retail)) but I think that data collection could face some regulatory roadblocks in the future - see the GDPR currently or more recently, the invalidation of "[...the European Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-statement-schrems-ii-ruling-and)". The most valuable asset that SMPs have captured is actually the consumer and their leisure time \\[there is a shit-ton of [math](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.8316&rep=rep1&type=pdf) behind this stuff too for those that understand mathematics - and you can also look up "value of leisure time pdf" for other studies\\]. I anticipate that SMPs are going to start to experience the effects of diminishing marginal returns in terms of the revenue derived from advertisements as ads continued to become more and more diluted on feeds. \n\nTWTR is just a place to express yourself, communicate, and enjoy catered content. Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \\[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency. \n\nTwitter\'s advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - (\'data licensing and other\' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers\' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).\n\nThe only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \\[10+ years down the line\\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for "premium" listings \\[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces. \n\nWhy TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.\n\n**tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \\[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation. \n\n**tl;dr** *see below position*\n\nTWTR $65c 01/21/2022 & long on the underlying']

Netflix has been one of the best performing tech stocks since the COVID-19 pandemic and Goldman has a target on it for $670 which I believe it will reach this year.

ETSY
['With advertisements making up significant parts of SMPs (Social Media Platforms\') revenues, yet becoming less and less effective - where do SMPs go from here? (The informal and lacking source for the advertisements being less effective is that like 1 in 3 instagram posts on your feed is an advertisement - and my entire friend group hadn\'t even realized how populated all the SMPs feeds have become until I pointed it out. And ECON 101 tells you when supply is up, demand usually falls). The only notable advertisement that I\'ve been able to formally recognize as coming from instagram was an Allbird advertisement - which has populated every single one of my feeds since I sent the link to a friend.\n\nData collection is already huge (look into an example big data is already being implemented [here](https://orbitalinsight.com/blog/global-parallels-realty-retail)) but I think that data collection could face some regulatory roadblocks in the future - see the GDPR currently or more recently, the invalidation of "[...the European Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-statement-schrems-ii-ruling-and)". The most valuable asset that SMPs have captured is actually the consumer and their leisure time \\[there is a shit-ton of [math](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.8316&rep=rep1&type=pdf) behind this stuff too for those that understand mathematics - and you can also look up "value of leisure time pdf" for other studies\\]. I anticipate that SMPs are going to start to experience the effects of diminishing marginal returns in terms of the revenue derived from advertisements as ads continued to become more and more diluted on feeds. \n\nTWTR is just a place to express yourself, communicate, and enjoy catered content. Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \\[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency. \n\nTwitter\'s advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - (\'data licensing and other\' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers\' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).\n\nThe only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \\[10+ years down the line\\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for "premium" listings \\[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces. \n\nWhy TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.\n\n**tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \\[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation. \n\n**tl;dr** *see below position*\n\nTWTR $65c 01/21/2022 & long on the underlying', 'According to TDA:  25.5% short interest on a company with a market cap of 21.4B?   \n\nEPS of -11.42.  Yet somehow they are in 2nd place in "Internet & Direct Marketing Retail industry" just behind Etsy?\n\nIs that not an insane short interest for such a large company?  I believe normal short interest is <3% or  so?  Even with all the speculation around Tesla, it\'s only at 9.47%.\n\nIs someone like Pershing Square betting against them?\n\nI\'d be interested in a short interest vs time info if anyone knows how to get at that.']

Car companies farm out r&d to 3rd parties, so if gm can buy someone's 3rd party battery, so can tesla.  Tesla has contracts with every battery supplier already, they are going to have dibs due to their existing relationships and their much higher volumes.  Meanwhile other car companies have no access to tesla chemistries.  This also ignores that two companies with the same chemistry won't even have the same performance or longevity.  The software controllers for the batteries are tweaking power in and out of the battery thousands of times a second to increase performance, charging rates, and longevity.  Anyone using tesla chemistries will still have to do all the research to tune the battery controllers on their own.\n\n>The whole business is priced based on a lot of speculative future earnings and a massive amount of investor confidence.

Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps", "> I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years \n\nSomebody get this guy on a conference call with the dude that's been making calls based on where his chickens shat. They might figure out the whole market", ">Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\nStopped reading after this you're clearly not retarded enough for this sub", '>masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years\n\n1. anyone whos a professor and posts a prediction of the S&P 500 crashing on this fucking place should have their degree taken away\n\n2. youve clearly never even been to a fucking university because professors have PhDs and if you dont youre only teaching basic micro and macro \n\n3. a masters in finance but you taught economics \n\nheres why your post is bullshit: your only reason for the idea of inflation is “BuT mUh JpooW PwInT tooMucH MooNy” but give no explanation for what gives the dollar its value and what conditions are changing that will have an effect on the dollar. \n\nheres how i know this post is even more bullshit: you didnt mention the CPI and probably dont know what it is. btw, CPI is taught in 100% of entry level econ courses.', 'Nice.

That’s no more than 5.5% a year. Hardly an avalanche of selling. He still has at least a billion dollars of stock, probably more depending on ownership structures, so at least 80% of his net worth based on current holdings, past sales, and my guess as to what his wealth was when he started this job (8 figures, which is small compared to his equity in Moderna). \n\nThese numbers look even better when you include stuff that is indirectly his as 100% his instead of like 50%  - current form 4 shows control of around 24 million shares, which is about 2 billion dollars. \n\nThe chief medical officer always sells his full grants whenever they vest. He wasn’t rich before this job, I assume he’s locking in his wealth level.  It’s like telling your wife or husband you shouldn’t take a bunch off the table and fund kids college, buy the house you want, etc when you make $5mil YOLOing 100k on tesla calls. Good luck with that if they are aware. He still has several hundred thousand future shares to vest in the future so he’s synthetically long via those at around 3 or 4 million, which is still a quarter or a third or something of his wealth. \n\nThey’ve done this stock up, stock down, stock sideways. The signals I take are - CEO bullish, CMO risk averse and disqualified from WSB membership. I kind of like the CMO to be a risk averse individual, he's making vaccines...", 'The two hours I don’t check the sec 4 form on them you get the scoop lol\n\nNice.

So gurufocus is wrong.', 'So these large sums of shares are owned by "Boston Biotech Ventures, LLC" and " OCHA LLC", right? So what if these companies, whos sole manger he is, decide to sell those shares? Does he still have to file a SEC form? Since they\'re technically not his shares?', 'Stock symbol TMT (Time machine travel ) had a huge day - lots of investor interest in traveling to the past  to repurchase Tesla as well as eliminating Covid before it begins .

ROCK
['CYBR:  CyberArk for those who don’t know is a cyber security software company.  A lot of cyber security has been pumped up lately because everyone thinks more work from home means the need for more cloud based cyber security.  Back in May CYBR bought a cloud security company so everyone is taking the bait that they are suddenly going to be super cloud focused.  Problem for them is they have historically struggled to build their cloud business.  Even if they do sell more cloud it doesn’t necessarily help them because the services fortheir on prem product delivers about 30% of their revenues.  So more cloud sales will not be a like for like revenue replacement.\n\nWe’re around the 3 month highs today, and I think this thing will sink like a rock heading into earnings.\n\nWhy will this go down? They keep missing the mark.  They lowered guidance on their last call from COVID concerns, and nothing in the sales trends I see at my job (competitor) indicate things are going well for them.  They haven’t made it far in any competitive bids I’ve been involved in. There’s just no momentum for them in the market.  With budgets tighter all around companies are looking for cheap solutions, and they are by far the most expensive in the PAM space in so many ways.\n\nPrice action: They tested the 120 mark and bounced, I don’t see a breakout happening.  Earnings are coming 8/4 and I expect a dive leading in.\n\n\nPossible reason to continue this upward trend: New Gartner Magic quadrant was supposed to come out already, and they’ll probably continue to be named the leader.  So that news could happen any day.\n\nPosition: 8/21 100p\nNot much volume but I like it', 'For those living under a rock, SPAC’s, also known as blank check companies, are piles of cash dedicated to acquiring an interest in a private company, so they can take it public. Ackman has structured his as a tontine. This will encourage early investors to hold onto their shares, in favor of a greater percentage of the warrants. He also doubled the traditional $10 PIPE shares and $11.50 warrants to $20 per share and $23 warrants.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation on what Ackman will pick, and you can take your best guess, but he wants a minority stake in the neighborhood of 15-30%. The SPAC has 4B in it, and he’s pledged 1-3B of Pershing’s money toward the deal. So we’re looking for something with a price tag between 16.6B and 46.6B. My opinion is that anything that big he picks is going to be a rocket ship once it’s brought to market. \n\nPosition: 470 shares in PSTH.U (The SPAC) & 400 shares in PSHZF (Pershing Square)', 'You didn’t read my comment.\n\nMuch like tech companies, Tesla’s stock isn’t based on demand but future expectations \n\nIf hype dies off, which is what is keeping it going right now, Tesla will drop like a rock', 'My nipples are rock hard', 'I’m guessing it’s gonna drop like a rock.

['With advertisements making up significant parts of SMPs (Social Media Platforms\') revenues, yet becoming less and less effective - where do SMPs go from here? (The informal and lacking source for the advertisements being less effective is that like 1 in 3 instagram posts on your feed is an advertisement - and my entire friend group hadn\'t even realized how populated all the SMPs feeds have become until I pointed it out. And ECON 101 tells you when supply is up, demand usually falls). The only notable advertisement that I\'ve been able to formally recognize as coming from instagram was an Allbird advertisement - which has populated every single one of my feeds since I sent the link to a friend.\n\nData collection is already huge (look into an example big data is already being implemented [here](https://orbitalinsight.com/blog/global-parallels-realty-retail)) but I think that data collection could face some regulatory roadblocks in the future - see the GDPR currently or more recently, the invalidation of "[...the European Commission’s adequacy decision underlying the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/07/us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-statement-schrems-ii-ruling-and)". The most valuable asset that SMPs have captured is actually the consumer and their leisure time \\[there is a shit-ton of [math](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.8316&rep=rep1&type=pdf) behind this stuff too for those that understand mathematics - and you can also look up "value of leisure time pdf" for other studies\\]. I anticipate that SMPs are going to start to experience the effects of diminishing marginal returns in terms of the revenue derived from advertisements as ads continued to become more and more diluted on feeds. \n\nTWTR is just a place to express yourself, communicate, and enjoy catered content. Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \\[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency. \n\nTwitter\'s advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - (\'data licensing and other\' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers\' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).\n\nThe only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \\[10+ years down the line\\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for "premium" listings \\[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces. \n\nWhy TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.\n\n**tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \\[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation. \n\n**tl;dr** *see below position*\n\nTWTR $65c 01/21/2022 & long on the underlying']

They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket.

AMD is having success on both it's major fronts. It's CPU wins should be well known and are the reason it has good cash flow: \n\n* Today it just announced two new OEM partnerships with laptop makers. \n* They are dominating Intel currently in the custom market\n* They are at least competitive in the mobile market somewhere Intel is not yet. \n* They are progressively chipping away at the server market share from Intel with cheaper hardware that outperforms much more expensive Intel hardware. \n* The Intel product line has repeatedly gotten criticism for being stale, unexciting and expensive and that was before their star engineer quit months ago\n* CPU partnerships lead to GPU partnerships\n* The fact that they are fabless means they have really good relationships with semiconductor makers. They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket. AMD has their CPU game on lock and their R&D is finally funding their GPU.

Separate from - but not entirely mutually exclusive from - pure-consumption platforms \\[AMZN, ETSY, MTCH, CVNA, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, SHOP, et cetera\\] where the end goal is to purchase their good/service with some common currency. \n\nTwitter\'s advertising service revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was about $682,192,000 - comprising about 84.5% of their revenue - (\'data licensing and other\' comprises the rest). And Twitter really just acts as a root node to some other specific consumption platform(s) based on your data tendencies - sending you elsewhere based on the engineers\' predictive algorithms. And algorithms would have to improve a hell of a lot to act as completely successful nodes to not only send you the right direction for some type of consumption - but for you to acknowledge the source of the utility and consumption was from their platform (though formal acknowledgement is already happening from the sell-side with platforms like SHOP, AYX - see minute 6:09 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FptWsowYkIM) for a quick example, et cetera).\n\nThe only viable and and regulatory-acceptable future \\[10+ years down the line\\] I see for SMPs is to act as virtual marketplaces - and to charge for "premium" listings \\[similar to the advantage that stores nearest to the exits and entrances in retail spaces have\\] - from which the advertisements and products would then have the most appeal. SMPs already have consumer data, the leisurely time, and a huge TAM - and my thoughts are all they would need is better predictive algorithms, less regulation (to collect/sell the data), and more advanced technology to implement simulation-like virtual marketplaces. \n\nWhy TWTR though? Recently I went to Portland, where I could not tell the homeless from the yuppies apart. Yet they were all for humanity, Goodwill shopping, and experiences as opposed to materialistic things. There is a ginormous TAM there, with money and credit anxiously waiting to be spent.\n\n**tl;dr** *[I think]* as-is advertisement mechanisms have potential, but in order to implement more effective predictive algorithms to act as nodes to the consumption platforms \\[e.g. me going to the Allbird website from my instagram feed\\] there needs to be more effective sensory data collection which could (and has) faced regulatory roadblocks. Virtual and communal marketplaces are the future with premium listings at the front of the simulation space (like storefront advertisement in actual retail spaces) catered to your data-driven patterns  --- which will come with improved technology, more advanced forms of data collection and algorithms, and less regulation. \n\n**tl;dr** *see below position*\n\nTWTR $65c 01/21/2022 & long on the underlying', 'MSFT EARNINGS', 'Thoughts on Microsoft Earnings tomorrow after hours?

MARK
['CYBR:  CyberArk for those who don’t know is a cyber security software company.  A lot of cyber security has been pumped up lately because everyone thinks more work from home means the need for more cloud based cyber security.  Back in May CYBR bought a cloud security company so everyone is taking the bait that they are suddenly going to be super cloud focused.  Problem for them is they have historically struggled to build their cloud business.  Even if they do sell more cloud it doesn’t necessarily help them because the services fortheir on prem product delivers about 30% of their revenues.  So more cloud sales will not be a like for like revenue replacement.\n\nWe’re around the 3 month highs today, and I think this thing will sink like a rock heading into earnings.\n\nWhy will this go down? They keep missing the mark.  They lowered guidance on their last call from COVID concerns, and nothing in the sales trends I see at my job (competitor) indicate things are going well for them.  They haven’t made it far in any competitive bids I’ve been involved in. There’s just no momentum for them in the market.  With budgets tighter all around companies are looking for cheap solutions, and they are by far the most expensive in the PAM space in so many ways.\n\nPrice action: They tested the 120 mark and bounced, I don’t see a breakout happening.  Earnings are coming 8/4 and I expect a dive leading in.\n\n\nPossible reason to continue this upward trend: New Gartner Magic quadrant was supposed to come out already, and they’ll probably continue to be named the leader.

SHIP
['For those living under a rock, SPAC’s, also known as blank check companies, are piles of cash dedicated to acquiring an interest in a private company, so they can take it public. Ackman has structured his as a tontine. This will encourage early investors to hold onto their shares, in favor of a greater percentage of the warrants. He also doubled the traditional $10 PIPE shares and $11.50 warrants to $20 per share and $23 warrants.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation on what Ackman will pick, and you can take your best guess, but he wants a minority stake in the neighborhood of 15-30%. The SPAC has 4B in it, and he’s pledged 1-3B of Pershing’s money toward the deal. So we’re looking for something with a price tag between 16.6B and 46.6B. My opinion is that anything that big he picks is going to be a rocket ship once it’s brought to market. \n\nPosition: 470 shares in PSTH.U (The SPAC) & 400 shares in PSHZF (Pershing Square)', 'Guys I’m fucked. I just got a text from my wife’s boyfriend saying my mom is going to stop sending me my monthly allowance because she saw a screenshot I posted on the internet (very unknown, underground expertise stock trading board, I don’t even know how a citizen like her found it) of my portfolio down 532% after I did a AZN 7/21 $60c as well as invested 73% of my portfolio into airline stocks two months ago (I thought it was a smart play because while the “experts” were saying to not buy, I could clearly see planes flying overhead so I knew something big was coming). Also I may have put my inheritance on TSLA puts. What’s the play that will get me back in the green so I can buy more tickets on this rocket ship. I keep trying to tell my mom the stock market is volatile (I don’t expect a wagecuck like her to know that tho) and that it’s important to continue to buy at the dips. But she said I’ve bought at the dip sixteen times now and is cutting off the debit card she gave me.

It's been over 6 years since I have worked there, but they tended to operate with a start-up mentality even though they were a fairly large company with substantial revenues by the time I joined.

['FE & its subsidiary, FES, were one and liable.\n\nThis case reminds me of SCANA and the eventual repeal of the surcharges for the failed nuclear projects in South Carolina down the road.\n\nGreat reporting :\n\n [https://www.dispatch.com/business/20200721/investigators-firstenergy-bankrolled-alleged-ohio-bribery-scheme](https://www.dispatch.com/business/20200721/investigators-firstenergy-bankrolled-alleged-ohio-bribery-scheme)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvestigators say Ohio Speaker of the House Larry Householder and others used $60 million from FirstEnergy to enrich themselves, *strengthen* their political power base and secure a $1.3 billion bailout for company subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions, a cost paid by new fees soon to appear on the bills of electric customers.\n\nInvestigators say the men arrested Tuesday in Ohio’s largest political corruption scandal called Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. their “bank.”\n\nNeil Clark, a powerful Republican lobbyist, said the Akron-based energy company would give them “unlimited money,” according to an affidavit filed Tuesday in the federal criminal case that rocked Ohio politics.\n\nFirstEnergy “got $1.3 billion in subsidies, free payments ... so what do they care about putting $20 million a year for this thing, they don’t give a sh\\*t,” Clark said during a July 2019 conversation that was recorded.\n\nInvestigators say Clark, Ohio Speaker of the House Larry Householder and others used $60 million from FirstEnergy to enrich themselves, *strengthen* their political power base and secure a $1.3 billion bailout for company subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions, a cost paid by new fees soon to appear on the bills of electric customers.\n\n“They’ve got too much money, too much power,” Clark said of FirstEnergy during the recorded conversation.\n\nFirstEnergy, Clark said, could keep paying them millions of dollars for 20 years if it wanted.\n\nThe Akron company and Energy Harbor, formerly known as FirstEnergy Solutions, did not respond to requests for comment. Both saw their stock prices drop by at least 17% Tuesday.\n\nFirstEnergy, which received subpoenas Tuesday in the ongoing federal investigation, is never named in the affidavit because neither the company nor any of its employees have yet been charged, the U.S. attorney handling the cases said Tuesday. In a brief statement late Tuesday, FirstEnergy said it was “reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate.”\n\nBut the company is clearly identified in the details throughout the affidavit, including the dates of its bankruptcy, words spoken by its CEO Charles Jones and its unique ownership of two nuclear power plants in Ohio.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dave DeVillers acknowledged Tuesday during a press conference that everyone knows the name of the unidentified company mentioned throughout the affidavit.\n\nFirstEnergy, which is among the 10 largest employers in Akron, began forecasting its own dire financial outlook in 2016. Of particular concern, company officials said, were two nuclear power plants operated by the company’s power generation arm, FirstEnergy Solutions.\n\nJones told investors in late 2017 that the company was considering various options, including a legislative bailout, selling off assets, filing bankruptcy or a combination of all three.\n\nThe timing coincided with Householder, who escaped an FBI investigation without facing charges more than a decade earlier, returning to state politics.\n\nSomehow — and it’s not yet clear how — a plan soon emerged that solved any of FirstEnergy’s money worries and also provided Householder the money and political power he wanted, the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit says Householder received a ride on a private jet FirstEnergy owned in January 2017. The Columbus Dispatch reported at the time that Householder and his son used the FirstEnergy jet to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSome time after that trip, money began to flow from FirstEnergy into a bank account belonging to a dark money group called Generation Now, which was controlled by Householder, the affidavit said.\n\nGroups like Generation Now can hide the names of donors per federal law. Generation Now was a prolific spender in the effort to pass a legislative bailout of FirstEnergy’s two failing nuclear power plants. Critics suspected that the dark money group was bankrolled by FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries, but the group’s campaign spokesman never revealed its donors.\n\nIn regular deposits of $250,000, investigators say Householder and his accomplices received a campaign war chest of $2.9 million to be used for their “personal benefit” and to help Householder win his speakership, according to the federal investigation.\n\nMillions more were spent in the spring and fall of 2018, during the state’s primary and general elections, to put candidates in office based on Householder’s and his accomplices’ beliefs that they would elect him speaker and support a legislative bailout worth $1.3 billion to FirstEnergy, according to the affidavit.\n\n...', "Consider moving. $2,000,000 would have been plenty for me to retire on here in the South. $4,600,000 is just extra gravy at this point.\n\nI like visiting SD/LA/Oceanside 3+ times every year for a week at a time, but I would never consider moving there because of the high state income tax. I would be in the 11.3% bracket in California, so I would have to write the state a check for about $55,000 for this one TSLA sale. I pay the state of Texas nothing. Crazy. I'd rather keep spending $2,000+ each trip I take to California.", "6/31???  It's July.  You invented time travel?  Dayum that's better than a Tesla or a trip to Mars, I'm in.", 'Everyone laughed at the play posting their call positons, that’s when I knew it was taking a trip to tendie town.']

Elon, give me gold if this is true.', 'so true', 'But true. Asians people sneeze when you talk about them, no matter the physical distance.\n\nIt is known.', "Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps", "That's a great point. I guess what I'm envisioning isn't true inflation, but the fear of inflation which leads to the Fed pulling back (which is terrible for equities). \n\nI agree that a healthy inflationary environment is good for stocks", "Hmm, well we'll see, you seem like a respectable human being so I believe you, but I think Trump says a lot of shit that may or may not be true when he's on camera", 'Who’s the dude in the back without a broker?Fuck that’s that PDT ban from every broker the true clown', 'LOL very true', "Haha, yeah everyone loves MSFT but it's TRUE, when uber cut 40% of jobs the stock went UP.\n\nThinning workforce is bullish", 'Yeah the prospects for BABA are really incredible.

I posted here last Q explaining why they would beat earnings, but it got deleted by the gay mods. Here is proof of my trade last earnings, they beat as I expected and I made 10k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options from Q3 bet](https://preview.redd.it/3m2ol2giicc51.jpg?width=883&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f38a03fd49bde388be66c3771eb8585a3b63d9)\n\n**Revenues**\n\nAphria is a Canadian LP and has 2 main revenue streams, cannabis sales & distribution revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Revenue Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/dz9ejr5licc51.jpg?width=785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f83911117265fc65e9362131e98fe1e2372e77cd)\n\nAphria is a hidden gem this quarter, as both of their revenue streams were positively affected by COVID-19- a big reason why they will beat this Q.\n\n**Distribution Revs**\n\nDistribution revenue comes from CC Pharma- a chain of 13,000 pharmacies throughout Europe but primarily located in Germany. CC Pharma was considered an essential service by the German Government and remained open throughout the pandemic and as a result saw a 15% increase in sales in March due to pantry loading; as indicated in their latest MD&A. While I don’t have access to sales for April or May, I expect April was similar to March while May returned to their usual sales. As you could see these revenues make up over 60% of their current revenues, while sales from CC are usually flat, a 5-10% increase over the quarter would set them on their way to beating earnings.\n\n**Cannabis Revs**\n\nThis is where most of the growth will come these earnings, as you can see in the picture above cannabis revenue increased by 22M, a 66% increase from the prior Q. Almost all of Aphria’s cannabis revenue comes from recreational sales, which will be the focus of this section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cannabis Rev Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/pre31mznicc51.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff64a572277a0f6ef8a56bb85ea381d00f1ebd0c)\n\nCOVID had a positive impact on Cannabis sales in Canada, dispensaries were considered essential services in most provinces during the lockdowns. Thankfully Health Canada shares the sales data so you don’t have to take my word for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canadian Rec Sales](https://preview.redd.it/0xid3ouqicc51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=504e9a884b5d1cbfaa9499a94d9d20c65cb720dc)\n\nSales grew to a record high in March, increasing 19% from the previous month. Not to be outdone, April had an even better month (6M/day vs 5.8M/day in March)- which is impressive because Ontario declared dispensaries non-essential for about a week before changing that decision and allowing delivery and curbside pickup. May continued to follow the trend and set another new high of 185M, totalling 547M for the quarter- a 20% increase from the past quarter.\n\nThe past 2 quarters have seen massive growth in rec sales for Aphria, in Q3 sales grew 54% while the market grew 17%, in Q2 sales grew 45% while the market grew 18%. They have continually increased their market share over the last few quarters, seeing an increase to 7.5% in Q2 and 9.5% in Q3. This is a trend we will likely see continue this quarter.\n\n***How will Aphria continue to increase sales?*** – What a great question, surprising coming from a group of autists like yourselves. In March 2019 Aphria received their license for part 4&5 of their Aphria One greenhouse. This added 800,000 square feet of additional growing space, bringing their growing capacity from 30,000kgs to 110,000kgs annually. In November Aphria added an additional 140,000kg of annualized cannabis production when their Aphria Diamond facility received it’s license, bringing its total annualized capacity to 225,000kgs. For those that aren’t familiar with the process, the grow cycle for cannabis is quite long, so the additional capacity has slowly increased every month, a big reason why they have been able to continually increase sales. The increased production capacity has also aligned perfectly with an increase in storefronts throughout Canada, last quarter saw an additional 184 stores open, a 30% increase from the end of November. This quarter has seen 130 stores open, a 16% increase from the end of February. Aphria will produce the most cannabis in company history this quarter, at the same time Canadians have access to more stores than ever before and it is clear that they are taking advantage as recreational sales in Canada are at an all time high.\n\nEverything is pointing towards a massive earnings beat for Aphria, which has historically resulted in a large increase in share price prior too earnings and on the day of earnings. Goodluck to everyone that chooses to buy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone interested in the sheer scale of a 800,00sqft greenhouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2AtMJfZdOg)', 'Is $OPK a pump and dump?

WINS
["Okay so this post is not for any quick moves.. this is advice for 6 months to a year. AMD is having success on both it's major fronts. It's CPU wins should be well known and are the reason it has good cash flow: \n\n* Today it just announced two new OEM partnerships with laptop makers. \n* They are dominating Intel currently in the custom market\n* They are at least competitive in the mobile market somewhere Intel is not yet. \n* They are progressively chipping away at the server market share from Intel with cheaper hardware that outperforms much more expensive Intel hardware. \n* The Intel product line has repeatedly gotten criticism for being stale, unexciting and expensive and that was before their star engineer quit months ago\n* CPU partnerships lead to GPU partnerships\n* The fact that they are fabless means they have really good relationships with semiconductor makers. They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket. AMD has their CPU game on lock and their R&D is finally funding their GPU. Just watch what happens if you want but I'm telling you how to make some trendies here.... just fucking be patient and don't buy calls for next week and go long.", "what is FVAC?\n\nFortress Value Acquisition was created after VC struck a merger deal with rare-earth metals producer MP Materials.\n\n- MP Materials supplies materials essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines, defense systems and many other advanced technologies, produced at its world-class, “green” mine and processing facility in Mountain Pass, CA\n- MP Materials poised to become the Western champion of rare earth magnetics, onshoring a critical sector that will power a sustainable future\n- Combined company to have an estimated post-transaction equity value of approximately $1.5 billion with over $500 million in net cash1 to fund growth strategy\n\nwhy FVAC?\n\n- rare metals play\n- Telsa uses neodymium in it's cars and MP Materials will be producing neodymium by year end.\n- wins on Biden infrastructure plan or on Trump China escalations.\n- only up 40% so far\n- Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital, invested in this. early FB. invested in AMZN.

That\'s why my average win is higher than my average loss, and why I have more wins than losses.\n\nAnd no, you\'re still 3/4s wrong about the YOLO. I didn\'t put my entire account into the play - only 1/4. \n\nIn any other terms, betting 1/4 of my account is definitely a crazy ass YOLO. But in terms of WSB, betting 1/4 of my account is 1/4 YOLO, as people on here regularly bet their entire accounts (and subsequently blow them up). My bet can be considered "risk management" here on WSB, and that\'s a god damn fact.', "Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps", 'If Biden wins the market is going in the fuckin tank.', 'The house always wins', 'LOL this wins', "JPOW's job is safe regardless of who wins the election. Remember when JPOW was still on diapers, helicopter Ben was already brrrring under bush and obama", "I highly doubt that whoever wins will have any incentive to keep brrrrrrring anymore. It's already well known that delaying a crisis via infinite QE will only make the eventual big crash worse and especially if the Virus is still wreaking havoc all across the US by that point. Wait for election results, eventual Fed meetings, then puts.", 'I have a ton of it and a ton more on order. I am going to make a lot this fall when Biden wins.', 'you gotta savour the wins.  for weeks sometimes.', 'You must be confused as to how theta gang wins all the time']

WIX
['WIX mooned up to and after their last earnings report. If you listened carefully to the call, their rate of new user acquisition was still increasing in April, and with the continued importance of e-commerce, I bet they’re still on a tear. I think they report again on August 6.\n\nBecause it has already run up so much, I would be surprised if it went up too much more, but maybe another 20%. Keep in mind, it took about a week for the share price to really take off after earnings, so pick your date and strike accordingly. \n\nI have shares, so it doesn’t matter to me when they go up. As long as they continue to look strong, I’ll continue to hold.']
